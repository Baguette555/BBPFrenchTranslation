# BALDI'S BASICS PLUS: French Translation
Thanks to the [BaldiTomorrowGames](https://github.com/BaldiTomorrowGames) team for giving me permission to use their [Git](https://github.com/BaldiTomorrowGames/TWGSRussifier) to be able to translate into French.

This mod of Baldi's Basics Plus changes subtitles, menus and assets in the same way as BB+!*

From posters to soda vending machines, every asset is translated into French, with French equivalent wordplay.

The mod will always be updated _after_ the official update. Expect delays after updates.
